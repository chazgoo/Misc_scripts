I suspect that the assembled genome provided by Zuoxi might have contaminating sequence, based on that >half of contigs did not blast-hit a closely related species. Check and see if GC content is bi/multimodal. 

```{r}
# Read in nuc_freqs for assembled UTEX2380 contigs
freqs = read.csv("/home/cagood/UPM_collab/UTEX2380/Seqs/UTEX2380/UTEX2380_oneline.fa_freq.tsv", sep = '\t')

# Read in TopHits against PCC8801 (non-hits won't appear)
tophits = read.csv("/home/cagood/UPM_collab/UTEX2380/blast/UTEX2380vsPCC8801.out_TopHits", header = F, sep = '\t')

tophits2 = read.csv("/home/cagood/UPM_collab/UTEX2380/blast/UTEX2380vsPCC7942.out_TopHits", header = F, sep = '\t')

# To freqs, add column (T or F) for whether freqID was hit
# First some basic formatting
freqs$X = gsub(">", "", freqs$X)
tophits = tophits[c(2:41),]

freqs$hit = freqs$X %in% tophits$V1 

freqs$hit2 = freqs$X %in% tophits2$V1

hits2not1 = subset(freqs, freqs$hit == FALSE && freqs$hit2 == TRUE) #Returns 0, fo ALL hits in 2 (less related) are in 1. 

#Subset
freqs$GC = freqs$C+freqs$G

hits = subset(freqs, freqs$hit == TRUE)
hits$GC = hits$C+hits$G

nonhits = subset(freqs, freqs$hit == FALSE)
nonhits$GC = nonhits$C+nonhits$G



#png(filename="GCtest.png")

plot(density(freqs$GC), ylim = c(0,60))
lines(density(hits$GC), col = "blue")
lines(density(nonhits$GC), col = "red")

#dev.off()
```

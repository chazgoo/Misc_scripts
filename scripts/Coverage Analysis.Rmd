This was my initial attempt at looking through coverage - I decided to use an entirely different pipeline based on BUSCO. 

Ignore this file, and instead go here: https://github.com/chazgoo/DIMENSIONS/tree/master/Coverage%20Analysis

```{r}
DC10_refT_heads <- read.delim("~/UMD/Delwiche Lab/Dimensions/RIPS_2018/Summary Stats/R/Monocultures/DC10/DC10_refT_headers.txt", header=F, sep="_")

DC10_refTG_heads <- read.delim("~/UMD/Delwiche Lab/Dimensions/RIPS_2018/Summary Stats/R/Monocultures/DC10/DC10_green_fasta_IDs.txt", header=F, sep="_")
```

```{r}
plot(density(log(DC10_refT_heads$V6)))
plot(density(log(DC10_refTG_heads$V6)))
plot(density(DC10_refTG_heads$V6), xlim = c(0, 1e+04))

mean(DC10_refT_heads$V6)
mean(DC10_refTG_heads$V6)
```

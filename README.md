## Miscellanious Scripts

A collection of bash, awk/sed, perl, python, and R scripts I've used in various bioinformatic processes and pipelines. A number of these are used in my other (better organized, but privately held until published) repositories. I wanted a place to allow free access to my code without compromising any of my proprietary research in progress. Here it is. Oneliners will be displayed, longer scripts will be linked.
